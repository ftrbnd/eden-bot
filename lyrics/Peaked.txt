dancing on my own
my feet are drawn to you
and lost at every sound
my heart cant fade it

mama said why you gotta waste my time?
i threw it to the wind no lie
its something that i need no crime
the call wont connect this time and
the substances we craved subsided
i never want to live half-sided

but still i persist on
i feel like were orphaned
my halo got all bent
i hate how i feel and
im not falling but i say nothing
i say nothing

no i cant believe you wanted me
i can not see the lining here
i fall asleep to sounds to dreams of you

are you losing me?
dont lose me
dont lose grip on me
feelings down on me
heart beats down on me

starin at the screen cos i feel no way
bleeding through the real life throw it on the wave
i can make you feel but could never make you stay
what do you want from me?
what do i hope to see?
i havent been home in weeks

still i can feel loved for now
and i can accept the paths youve taken
and if all this dies out ill be good
still im down

dancing on my own
my feet are drawn to you
been lost at every sound
my heart cant fade out
